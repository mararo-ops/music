# Local Art Gallery Management System 

## Introduction

The Local Art Gallery Management System is a command-line application designed to assist art galleries in managing artists, artworks, and overall gallery data. This README provides essential information for setting up, using, and contributing to the project.

## Problem Statement

Art galleries often face challenges in efficiently organizing and managing information about artists and their artworks. A lack of a centralized system can lead to difficulties in tracking artists, managing their works, and providing a seamless experience for gallery administrators.
